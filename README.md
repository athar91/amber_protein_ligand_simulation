# Molecular Dynamics Simulation Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up and running a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for a protein-ligand complex using the AMBER molecular dynamics software suite.

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will simulate the prescription drug Sustiva (Efavirenz) in complex with HIV-1 REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE. Efavirenz is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) specific, non-nucleoside, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb for controlling the progression of HIV infection in humans.
The chemical name for Sustiva is  (S)-6-chloro-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one.
Our Efavirenz bound RT pdb file is downloaded from (PDB ID [1FKO](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1FKO)). The coordinates of sustiva are associated with a residue called "EFZ" (Efavirenz).

## Test Environment
The tutorial assumes the following test environment:

```bash
mathar@freddie:~/cheetah/andrea_files/try/tutorial8 

### Source the amber program


```
## Steps

## 1. Download PDB Structure
Download a PDB structure file for your protein-ligand complex. In this tutorial, we'll use the example structure `1fko.pdb`.


## 2. Prepare Protein Structure
Open the PDB structure in VMD and save only the protein coordinates using the following VMD selection:
```bash
(chain A and resid 1 to 243 or resname EFZ)
```
Save the protein structure as 1fko_trunc.pdb.

## 3. Clean and Prepare Ligand
Clean the ligand structure using pdb4amber, grep, reduce, and antechamber. Run the following commands:

pdb4amber is a tool that helps to preprocess PDB files for AMBER simulations.
```bash
pdb4amber -i 1fko_trunc.pdb -o 1fko_trunc_clean.pdb --add-missing-atoms --no-reduce-db --most-populous
```


grep EFZ
```bash
grep EFZ 1fko_trunc_clean.pdb > EFZ.pdb
```


reduce is a tool for adding hydrogen atoms to a PDB file
```bash
reduce EFZ.pdb > EFZ_H.pdb
```
 antechamber: We shall use Antechamber to assign atom types to this molecule and also calculate a set of point charges. Antechamber is the most important program within the set of Antechamber tools. It can perform many file conversions and can also assign atomic charges and atom types. Depending on its inputs, antechamber executes the following programs (all provided with AmberTools): sqm, atomtype, am1bcc, bondtype, espgen, respgen and prepgen.
```bash
antechamber -i EFZ_H.pdb -fi pdb -o EFZ_H.mol2 -fo mol2 -c bcc -s 2
```
Alternatively, you can use Acpype server to generate the forcefield topology using https://www.bio2byte.be/acpype/

parmchk2 to test if all the parameters we require are available
```bash
parmchk2 -i EFZ_H.mol2 -f mol2 -o EFZ_H.frcmod
```
# 4. Create Leap Input Files
Create two TLEAP input files (tleap.in and tleap2.in) with the provided content.

[tleap.in](tleap.in)
```bash
source leaprc.protein.ff19SB
source leaprc.gaff2
source leaprc.water.tip3p
EFZ = loadmol2 EFZ_H.mol2
check EFZ
loadamberparams EFZ_H.frcmod
saveoff EFZ EFZ.lib
saveamberparm EFZ ligand.prmtop ligand.inpcrd
quit
```
[tleap2.in](tleap2.in)
```bash
source leaprc.protein.ff19SB
source leaprc.gaff2
source leaprc.water.tip3p
loadamberparams EFZ_H.frcmod
loadoff ligand.lib
complex = loadpdb 1fko_trunc_clean.pdb
solvatebox complex TIP3PBOX 12
addionsrand complex K+ 0
addionsrand complex Cl- 0
saveamberparm complex 1fko_trunc_clean.prmtop 1fko_trunc_clean.inpcrd
savepdb complex 1fko_trunc_param.pdb
quit
```
## 5. Run TLEAP
Run TLEAP to create initial structure files:
```bash
tleap -f tleap.in
tleap -f tleap2.in
```
## 6. Prepare MD Run Scripts
Create bash scripts [run_md.sh](run_md.sh) for running the MD simulation.

Simulation Stages
The MD simulation will undergo the following stages:

Energy Minimization1: The entire system undergoes minimization.


Energy Minimization2: Restraint applied only to the protein backbone.


Energy Minimization3: Restraint applied only to the alpha carbons (CÎ±) of the protein.


Equilibration0: Without any restraints.


Equilibration1: System is heated from 0K to 310K and undergoes molecular dynamics simulations.


Equilibration2: Equilibrating the system at constant temperature and pressure (NTP ensemble).


Production Molecular Dynamics: System undergoes long molecular dynamics simulations in the NTP ensemble.


### run the [run_md.sh] (run_md.sh)  
```bash 
nohup bash run_md.sh &
```
