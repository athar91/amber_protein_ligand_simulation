Protein-Ligand MD Simulation using AMBER
This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up and running a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for a protein-ligand complex using the AMBER molecular dynamics software suite.
We will be simulating prescription drug Sustiva (Efavirenz) in complex with HIV-1 REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE. Efavirenz is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) specific, non-nucleoside, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb for controlling the progression of HIV infection in humans. The chemical name for Sustiva is  (S)-6-chloro-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one.
Our Efavirenz bound RT pdb file is downloaded from (PDB ID 1FKO ). The coordinates of sustiva are associated with a residue called "EFZ" (Efavirenz).
By all means open it up in VMD and take a look at it.
